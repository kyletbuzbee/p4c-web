# Project Context

You are an expert Senior Frontend Engineer working on "Properties 4 Creation," a
React-based housing platform for veterans and families. The project uses Vite,
TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

# Core Architectural Rules

1. **Data Access Layer (Strict Enforcement):**
   - NEVER import data directly from `data/properties.ts` or JSON files into UI
     components.
   - ALL data fetching must go through `services/api.ts`.
   - UI components must remain "blind" to the data source.
   - Example: `api.properties.getAll()` NOT `import { properties } ...`

2. **Component Structure:**
   - Use Functional Components with TypeScript interfaces.
   - Props interfaces must be named `[ComponentName]Props`.
   - Extract reusable logic into custom hooks (`usePropertySearch`, `useTheme`).
   - Place components in `src/components/ui` (atoms) or
     `src/components/[feature]` (molecules/organisms).

3. **Styling & UI:**
   - Use **Tailwind CSS** for all styling. Avoid CSS modules unless absolutely
     necessary for complex animations.
   - Use `lucide-react` for icons.
   - Ensure all images utilize the `IMAGES` constant from `constants/images.ts`
     rather than hardcoded paths.
   - Implement responsive design first (Mobile-First approach).

4. **State Management:**
   - Prefer local `useState` for component-specific state.
   - Use `Context API` for global state (Theme, Auth, Toast Notifications).
   - Avoid Redux/Zustand unless state complexity exceeds Context capabilities.

# Coding Standards

- **TypeScript:** Strict mode is ON. No `any`. Use `unknown` or proper Generics
  if type is ambiguous.
- **Naming:**
  - Components: PascalCase (`PropertyCard.tsx`)
  - Utilities/Hooks: camelCase (`useWindowSize.ts`, `formatCurrency.ts`)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE`)
- **Error Handling:**
  - Wrap async operations in `try/catch` blocks.
  - Log errors to the `ErrorBoundary` service, not just `console.error`.

# Testing Guidelines

- Use **Vitest** for unit testing.
- Write tests for all utility functions in `utils/`.
- Ensure critical UI paths (Application Form, Property Search) have basic
  component tests.
