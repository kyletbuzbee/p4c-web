Phase 2: Component & Page Implementation
1. Home Page (src/pages/Home.tsx)
A. Calculator Section (East Texas Acquisitions)
Goal: Functional "Seller Net Sheet" (How much we pay).

State Logic:

TypeScript
const [arv, setArv] = useState<number>(0); // After Repair Value
const [repairs, setRepairs] = useState<number>(0);
// Formula: (ARV * 0.70) - Repairs = Max Cash Offer
const offerPrice = (arv * 0.70) - repairs;
UI Layout:

Two inputs (Currency formatted).

One prominent result card: "Your Cash Offer".

Style: Dark Navy background (bg-[#0B1120]) with Gold text (text-[#C5A059]) for the result.

B. Community Revitalization Section
Hero Replacement: Swap the static <img> for a background video.

TypeScript
<video
  autoPlay loop muted playsInline
  className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover opacity-60"
  src="/images/videos/hero-our-work-banner.mp4"
/>
Overlay: Ensure text remains readable with a black overlay (bg-black/50).

C. Content Architecture
Delete: Remove the <TenantSuccessStories /> component from Home.tsx completely.

Renovation Card:

Update Link: <Link to="/construction-standards">View Construction Specs</Link>

Family Resources:

Update Banner prop: src="/images/banners/family-resources-banner.png"

Rental Application:

CSS Fix: Locate the h2 or title class. Remove line-through or decoration-line-through.

2. About Page (src/pages/About.tsx)
A. Hero Section
Image: src="/images/banners/hero-about-banner.webp"

Overlay Text: "Revitalizing East Texas, One Home at a Time."

B. Leadership Section ("Professional Excellence")
Refactor: Replace generic text with a 2-Column Leadership Grid.

Col 1 (Owner):

Image: /images/about/about-us-team-owner.webp

Name: Richard Lonkert

Role: Owner & Veteran

Bio: Focus on his veteran background and vision for housing families.

Col 2 (Partner):

Image: /images/about/about-us-team-headshot.webp

Name: Kyle Buzbee

Role: Managing Partner

Styling: Use rounded-xl images with shadow-lg.

C. Timeline Component
Replace: Remove "Integrity, Quality, Growth" cards.

Implement: A vertical timeline showing the journey.

2018: Founded.

2020: First Multi-family acquired.

2023: Veteran Housing Initiative.

Future: 500+ Families Housed.

3. Community Page (src/pages/Community.tsx)
A. Hero Section
Background: Use Video /images/videos/hero-our-work-banner.mp4.

B. Revitalization Cycle (The "How We Create Value" Merge)
Layout: Horizontal Process Steps (Arrow flow).

Step 1: Acquisition

Image: /images/about/acquisition.png

Text: "Identifying distressed properties."

Step 2: Rehabilitation

Image: /images/about/rehabilitaion.png

Text: "Professional renovation to modern standards."

Step 3: Stabilization

Image: /images/properties/tyler-ranch-home.webp

Text: "Placing families in safe, forever homes."

C. Investor Prospectus
Action: The "Request Prospectus" button is dead.

Fix: onClick={() => setIsContactModalOpen(true)} (Or link to /contact).

4. Resident Reviews (src/pages/Reviews.tsx)
A. Video Section Fix
Problem: 3 duplicate videos.

Solution: Map specific posters to specific videos.

TypeScript
const videos = [
  { id: 1, poster: "/images/resident-review/resident-review-mark.png", src: "/videos/review-1.mp4" },
  { id: 2, poster: "/images/resident-review/resident-review-alex.png", src: "/videos/review-2.mp4" },
  { id: 3, poster: "/images/resident-review/resident-review-sarah.png", src: "/videos/review-3.mp4" },
];
(Note: If actual video files are missing, reuse hero-our-work-banner.mp4 temporarily, but ensure the Posters are unique so they look different).

B. Content Migration
Add: Paste the <TenantSuccessStories /> component (removed from Home) into the bottom of this page.

5. Construction Page (src/pages/Construction.tsx)
A. Banner & Card
Banner: src="/images/banners/home-renovation-banner.webp" (or hero-projects-banner.webp).

Card Design:

Add border-l-4 border-[#C5A059] (Gold border).

Add hover:shadow-2xl transition-shadow duration-300.

Content: Bullet points for "HVAC", "Roofing", "Flooring", "Safety".

6. Careers Page (src/pages/Careers.tsx)
A. Banner Cleanup
Image: src="/images/banners/career-banner.png"

Text: Find <h1>We hire veterans first</h1> and delete it. Keep the main title "Join Our Team".

7. Resident Services (src/pages/ResidentServices.tsx)
A. Banner
Image: src="/images/banners/resident-service-banner.png"

B. Portal Logic
Fix: The form likely has type="submit" but no onSubmit handler, or it reloads the page.

Code:

TypeScript
const handleLogin = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  // Add authentication logic or Toast "Login service coming soon"
  toast.info("Resident Portal is currently under maintenance.");
};
8. Homeowner Solutions (src/pages/Homeowner.tsx)
A. Testimonials
Edit: Find the testimonial signed by "Robert". Change signature to "Properties 4 Creation Team".

9. Contact Page (src/pages/Contact.tsx)
A. Professional Form
Banner: /images/banners/hero-contact-banner.png

Input Styling:

className="w-full rounded-md border-gray-300 shadow-sm focus:border-[#C5A059] focus:ring-[#C5A059]"

Submit Button:

bg-[#0B1120] text-white hover:bg-[#C5A059] transition-colors.
